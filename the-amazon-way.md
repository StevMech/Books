Develop clarity and simplicity in what you are doing - and not doing<br /><br />The fundamental mistake leaders make in developing digital strategies is not seeking clarity regarding the customer experience. <br /><br /> At Amazon, leaders write narratives of plans. They start with the end in mid via a future press release or deliberately assess how to measure long-term success of a capability of team. Begin with a clear, simple roadmap to the destination| xii (Prolog)
In the 2015 shareholder letter, Bezos called Amazon "the greatest company to fail at". Amazon is doubling its number of experiments and has a clear portfolio mentality between "scaling investments" that have a lear ROI versus "bets" that often fail. The strategy is to lay lots of bets at an affordable price <br /><br /> To avoid the ABCs (arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency), set the expectation and forcing functions to create a culture with a high Change IQ. | xiii (Prolog)
Jeff asked me a deceptively simply question, "How many merchants have launched since the first of the year?". I responded, "Well, you see, as of right now-" Before I could finish, Jeff erupted. "The answer to that question begins with a _number_!"<br /><br />The ensuing rant is...an educational exercise htat uses my situation as an opportunity to transmit a series of cultural, strategic, and operational messages to the leaders of the company.<br />In the next five minutes Jeff touches on a half dozen principles as he describes my shortcomings in painful detail. I am chastised for my failure to sufficiently obsess over the customer, for not taking complete ownership of my project and its outcomes, for not setting higher standards for myself and my team, for not thinking big enough, for not possessing a bias for action and for not being firmly and vocally self-critical when it was clear my performance was lacking.| pg 1
Amazon's leaders work hard to make their thinking very clear - to be clear not only about _what_ they decide but about precisely _why_ they decide. The quest for clarity has created an organization whose actions are based on a specific philosophy and consistent set of values and principles.|pg 4
