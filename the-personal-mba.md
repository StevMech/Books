## Opinon
I quite liked this book. It provides standard a framework, concepts and jargon around something very large (business) field. Personally, I found the first half more useful than the second. 

## Points of note

### Value Creation

pg 38 - [The Five Parts of Every Business](https://personalmba.com/5-parts-of-every-business/)

> See book: Ready, Fire Aim

pg 45 - [Ten Ways to Evaluate a Market](https://personalmba.com/10-ways-to-evaluate-a-market/)
> 1. Urgency - How badly do people want or need this right now
> 2. Market size - How many people are actively purchasing things like this?
> 3. Pricing Potential - What is the highest price a typical purchaser would be willing to spend for a solution
> 4. Cost of Customer Acquisition - How easy is it to acquire a new customer? How much money and effort does it take to generate a sale?
> 5. Cost o Value Delivery - how much would it cost to reate and deliver the value offered, both in money and effort?
> 6. Uniqueness of Offer - How unique is your offer versus competing offereings in the market, and how easy is it for potential competitors to copy you?

> 9. Upsell Potential - Are there related secondary offers that you could also present to purchasing customers?
> 10. Evergreen Potential - Once the initial offer has been created, how much additional work will you have to put into it in order to continue selling?

pg 75 - [Economic Values](https://personalmba.com/economic-values/)

> 2. Speed - How fast does it work?
> 3. Reliability - Can I depend on it to do what I want?

> These can be categorized into convenience and fidelity. Things that are quick, reliable, easy and flexible are convenient. Things that offer quality, status, aesthetic appeal or emotional impact are high-fidelity. It's incredibly difficult to optimize for both fidelity and convenience at the same time. 
> The Trade-Offs that are made in the development of new offerings are what give each option its unique identity

pg 77 - [Relative Importance Testing](https://personalmba.com/relative-importance-testing/)
> Relative Importance Testing can help you quickly determine which benefits you shoiuld focus on to make your offering maximally attractive. They are is a set of analysis techniques that give you a way to determine what people actually want by asking them a series of simple quetions designed to simulate real-life Trade-offs. For example, we show the following options:
> A. Orders delivered to table in five minutes or less
> B. Most entree prices under $20
> C. Appealing restaurant decor
> D. Large variety of menu options
> After this set is shown, the participant is asked:
> 1. Which of these items is most important
> 2. Which of these items is least important
> Once answered, they are shown another set of questions. Random question sets containing four or five criteria are provided until there are no more possible combinations or the participant's attention wanders, typically around the five- to ten-minute mark.

pg 79 - [Critical Assumptions](https://personalmba.com/critical-assumptions/)
> Critical Assumptions are facts or characteristics that must be true in the real world for your business or offereing to be successful.

Note that Eric Reis calls these "leap of faith assumptions" in Lean Startup

pg 80 - [Shadow Testing](https://personalmba.com/shadow-testing/)
> Shadow testing is the process of selling an offering before it actually exists. Be up front with your potential customers that the offering is still in development.

### Marketing

pg 106 - [Call to Action](https://personalmba.com/call-to-action/)
> Your prospects can't read your mind. If you want your prospects to take the next step you're encouraging, you need to tell them exactly what to do. The most effective marketing strategies give the recipient or prospect a single very clear very short action to take next. 
> The best Calls-To-Action ask directly either for the sale or for Permission to follow up.

### Sales

pg 128 - [Three Dimensions of Negotiation](https://personalmba.com/3-dimensions-of-negotiation/)

Setup

> Who is involved, what are you proposing, what's the setting, what are the environmental factors of the deal that make this more or less important to the other party?

Structure

> What exactly will you propose, how will you frame it, what are the benefits to the other party, what's they other party's Next Best Alternative and how is your proposal better, how will you overcome their objections and are there concessions you're willing to make to reach an aggrement

Discussion

> This is where you talk through your proposal to the other party. Outcomes are either "yes", "not yet" or "no"

### Value Delivery

pg 143

> Value Delivery involves everything necessary to ensure that every paying customer is a happy customer: order processing, inventory management, delivery/fulfillment, troubleshooting, customer support, etc.

pg 145 - [Value Stream](https://personalmba.com/value-stream/)

> A Value Stream is the set of all steps and all processes from the start of your Value Creation process all the way through the delivery of the end result to your customer.

> You can think of the Value Stream as a combination of your Value Creation and Value Delivery processes.

pg 158 - [Force Multiplier](https://personalmba.com/force-multiplier/)

> As a general rule, the only good use of debt or outside capital in setting up a system is to give you access to Force Multipliers you would not be able to access any other way. 

> Always choose the best tools you can afford. By investing in Force Multipliers, you free up time, energy and attention to focus on building instead of just operating

pg 160 - [Systemization](https://personalmba.com/systemization/)

> If you can't describe what you are doing as a process, you don't know what you're doing

### Finance

pg 171 - [Cash Flow Statement](https://personalmba.com/cash-flow-statement/)

> The cash flow statement is straightforward: it's an examination of a company's bank account over a certain period of time.

> Cash tends to move in three primary areas: operations (selling offers and buying inputs), investing (collecting dividends and paying for capital expenses) and financing (borrowing money and paying it back). Cash Flow statements usually track these sources separately.

> May investors use a metric called "free cash flow" when evaluating companies. This metric comes from the cash flow statement: it's the amount of cash a business collects from operations minus cash spent for capital equipment and assets. 

pg 174 - [Balance Sheet](https://personalmba.com/balance-sheet/)

> Assets - Liabilities = Owner's Equity

and

> Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity

> This looks odd: why would you ever wnant to add Liabilities and Owner's Equity? Here's why: when a business borrows money, it receives the amount of cash borrowed. That goes on the clash flow statement, and the influx of money makes it look like the business had a very good month if you don't notice it's a loan.

pg 176 - [Financial Ratios](https://personalmba.com/financial-ratios/)

> Comparing ratios to industry averages makes it easy to see if the company is performing like a typical company or if something is odd. They are useful for sanity-checking profit, debt, cash and efficiency. There are thousands; analysts tend to choose a small set based on the industry (it makes no sense to calculate inventory for a service business)

> 1. Profitability ratios indicate he ability to generate profit. Net Profit / total assets
> 2. Leverage ratios show how the company uses debt. Total liability / shareholder's equity ("debt-to-equity")
> 3. Liquidity ratios indicate the ability of a business to pay its bills and can be used to see if business is sitting on cash instead of investing. "Current Ratio" - current assets / current liabilities. "Quick Ratio" - current assets minus inventory / current liabilities
> 4. Efficiency ratios indicate how well a business is managing its inventory (either too little or too much is bad). "Day Sales Outstanding" shows how long it takes to collect the cash from sales

pg 181 - [Lifetime Value](https://personalmba.com/lifetime-value/)

> Is the total value of a customer's business over the lifetime of their relationship with your company.

Many businesses that used to offer pay-once products now offer subscription-type services. IDEs, music, even [WiFi routers](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/12/17416982/plume-superpod-adaptive-wifi-subscription-service-announced)

pg 183 - [Allowable Acquisition Cost](https://personalmba.com/allowable-acquisition-cost/)

> AAC is the marketing component of Lifetime Value. The higher the avg Lifetime Value, the more you can spend to attract a new customer.

> Having a high Lifetime Value allows you to lose money on the first sale ("loss leader").

> Calculation: Avg customer Lifetime Value minus Value Stream costs minus (Overhead / total customer base) * (1 - desired profit margin).

> Example: $2000 (Lifetime Value over 5 years) - $500 (Value Stream) = $1500 (Revenue per customer). $500,000 (Overhead over 5 years) / 500 (number of customers) = $1000 per customer (Fixed Costs). So $1500 - $1000 = $500 in revenue before marketing expenses. If you're shooting for 60% profit margin you can afford to spend 40% of the revenue on marketing so $500 * 0.4 = $200 AAC per customer

pg 184 - [Costs: Fixed and Variable](https://personalmba.com/costs-fixed-variable/)

> Reductions in Fixed Costs (e.g. Overhead) Accumulate: if you can save $50/month on your phone bill this Accumulates to $600/year. 

> Reductions in Variable Costs (e.g. cost of product) are Amplified by volume: if you can save $0.50 on each T-shirt you produce, you'll save $500 on every 1000 T-shirts.

pg 189 - [Amortization](https://personalmba.com/amortization/)

> The process os spreading the cost of a resource investment over the estimated useful life of that investment. Say you produce stuffed dogs and want to buy a factory; let's assume the factory can produce 10 million units during its life. On a per-unit basis, that brings the cost per unit of the factory down to $10. If you sell every unity you make for $100, that's a healthy Profit Margin.

> If you have a reliable estimate of how much it will cost and how much you can produce, Amortization helps you figure out whether or not investing large amounts of Capital makes sense. Amortization depends on an accurate prediction of useful life.

pg 205 - [Sunk Costs](https://personalmba.com/sunk-cost/)

Sunk costs are like quicksand and too much can get you into a dangerous position where you throw bad money after good.

> Easy to understand conceptually but much harder to put into practice. When you sink years of work into a career you realize you don't want, it's tough to walk away. Don't pour concrete into a bottomless pit; walk away. 

> *You never have to earn back money the same way to lost it*

pg 205 - [Internal Controls](https://personalmba.com/internal-controls/)

> Tracking financial and operations data (via SOPs) over time lets you identify patterns in your revenue, costs and Value Chain. These become useful for budgeting, supervising operations, compliance and preventing theft and fraud.

> Every year, the [Risk Management Association](https://www.rmahq.org/) compiles a huge amount of data and makes it easy to discover what solvent businesses of various sizes spend on marketing, sales, operations and capital in a given period of time. Banks and investors rely on RMA data to determine whether or not a business they're examinging is typical.

> Industry groups can also be a useful source of data. By comparing your business's data to that of other companies in your market, you can get a better picture of how well you're performing and where your business could use improvement.
