## Opinon
I quite liked this book. It provides standard a framework, concepts and jargon around something very large (business) field. Personally, I found the first half more useful than the second.

> These can be categorized into convenience and fidelity. Things that are quick, reliable, easy and flexible are convenient. Things that offer quality, status, aesthetic appeal or emotional impact are high-fidelity. It's incredibly difficult to optimize for both fidelity and convenience at the same time. 
> The Trade-Offs that are made in the development of new offerings are what give each option its unique identity

pg 77 - [Relative Importance Testing](https://personalmba.com/relative-importance-testing/)
> Relative Importance Testing can help you quickly determine which benefits you shoiuld focus on to make your offering maximally attractive. They are is a set of analysis techniques that give you a way to determine what people actually want by asking them a series of simple quetions designed to simulate real-life Trade-offs. For example, we show the following options:
> A. Orders delivered to table in five minutes or less
> B. Most entree prices under $20
> C. Appealing restaurant decor
> D. Large variety of menu options
> After this set is shown, the participant is asked:
> 1. Which of these items is most important
> 2. Which of these items is least important
> Once answered, they are shown another set of questions. Random question sets containing four or five criteria are provided until there are no more possible combinations or the participant's attention wanders, typically around the five- to ten-minute mark.

pg 79 - [Critical Assumptions](https://personalmba.com/critical-assumptions/)
> Critical Assumptions are facts or characteristics that must be true in the real world for your business or offereing to be successful.

Note that Eric Reis calls these "leap of faith assumptions" in Lean Startup

pg 80 - [Shadow Testing](https://personalmba.com/shadow-testing/)
> Shadow testing is the process of selling an offering before it actually exists. Be up front with your potential customers that the offering is still in development.

### Marketing

pg 106 - [Call to Action](https://personalmba.com/call-to-action/)
> Your prospects can't read your mind. If you want your prospects to take the next step you're encouraging, you need to tell them exactly what to do. The most effective marketing strategies give the recipient or prospect a single very clear very short action to take next. 
> The best Calls-To-Action ask directly either for the sale or for Permission to follow up.

### Sales

pg 128 - [Three Dimensions of Negotiation](https://personalmba.com/3-dimensions-of-negotiation/)

Setup

> Who is involved, what are you proposing, what's the setting, what are the environmental factors of the deal that make this more or less important to the other party?

Structure

> What exactly will you propose, how will you frame it, what are the benefits to the other party, what's they other party's Next Best Alternative and how is your proposal better, how will you overcome their objections and are there concessions you're willing to make to reach an aggrement

Discussion

> This is where you talk through your proposal to the other party. Outcomes are either "yes", "not yet" or "no"

### Value Delivery

pg 143

> Value Delivery involves everything necessary to ensure that every paying customer is a happy customer: order processing, inventory management, delivery/fulfillment, troubleshooting, customer support, etc.

pg 145 - [Value Stream](https://personalmba.com/value-stream/)

> A Value Stream is the set of all steps and all processes from the start of your Value Creation process all the way through the delivery of the end result to your customer.

> You can think of the Value Stream as a combination of your Value Creation and Value Delivery processes.

pg 158 - [Force Multiplier](https://personalmba.com/force-multiplier/)

> As a general rule, the only good use of debt or outside capital in setting up a system is to give you access to Force Multipliers you would not be able to access any other way. 

> Always choose the best tools you can afford. By investing in Force Multipliers, you free up time, energy and attention to focus on building instead of just operating

pg 160 - [Systemization](https://personalmba.com/systemization/)

> If you can't describe what you are doing as a process, you don't know what you're doing

pg 171 - [Cash Flow Statement](https://personalmba.com/cash-flow-statement/)

> The cash flow statement is straightforward: it's an examination of a company's bank account over a certain period of time.

> Cash tends to move in three primary areas: operations (selling offers and buying inputs), investing (collecting dividends and paying for capital expenses) and financing (borrowing money and paying it back). Cash Flow statements usually track these sources separately.

> May investors use a metric called "free cash flow" when evaluating companies. This metric comes from the cash flow statement: it's the amount of cash a business collects from operations minus cash spent for capital equipment and assets. 

pg 174 - [Balance Sheet](https://personalmba.com/balance-sheet/)

> Assets - Liabilities = Owner's Equity

and

> Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity

> This looks odd: why would you ever wnant to add Liabilities and Owner's Equity? Here's why: when a business borrows money, it receives the amount of cash borrowed. That goes on the clash flow statement, and the influx of money makes it look like the business had a very good month if you don't notice it's a loan.
