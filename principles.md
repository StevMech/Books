Powerful stuff in here. Fun to read but value comes from using is as a reference and considering his framework so you can come up with your own.

Print out the Summary and Table of Life and Work principles from the middle of the book and hang above your desk.

Simply put, governance is the system of checks and balances ensuring that an organization will be stronger than whoever happens to be leading it at any one time.<br /> <br /> I had learned that it's wrong to assume either that a person in one role will be successful in another role or that the ways one person operates will work well for another. | 119
Seeing things from the top down is the best way to understand ourselves | 139
Nature optimizes fo the whole, not for the individual, but most people judge good and bad based only on how it affects them.| 140
Adaptation through rapid trial and error is invaluable <br /> <br /> I used to think that memory-based conscious learning was the most powerful way to think but I've since come to understand that it produces less rapid progress than experimentation and adaptation.  <br /> <br /> **Nature improves without thinking** <br /> <br /> Note: Consistent thinking with Agile, Lean, Customer Development, etc | 148
If you can develop a reflexive reaction to psychic pain that causes you to reflect on it rather than avoid it, it will lead to your rapid learning/evolving  <br /> <br /> If you're not failing you're not pushing your limits, and if you're not pushing your limits, you're not maximizing your potential <br /> <br /> Every time you confront something painful, you are at a potentially important juncture in your life| 152
Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a great skill that you should devlop no matter what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will prevent you from doing what you shouldn't be doing. All successful people are good at this| 161
  **1. Don't confuse what you wish were true with what is really true. <br />  2. Don't worry about looking good - worry about achieving your goals <br /> 3. Don't overweight first-order consequences reletive to second- and third-order ones <br />4. Don't let pain stand in the way of progress<br />5. Don't blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself**| 162
Five step process to get what you want out of life: <br />1. Have clear goals<br />2. Identify and don't tolerate the problems that stand in the way of achieving those goals<br />3. Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes <br />4. Design plans that will get you around them<br />5. Do what's necessary to push these designs through to results<br /><br />To evolve quickly, you willd have to do this fast and continuously, setting your goals successively higher<br />| 169
**When setting goals, just set goals.** Don't think about how you will achieve them or what you will do if something goes wrong. When you are diagnosing problems, don't think about how you will solve them. Blurring the steps leas to suboptimal outcomes because it interferes with uncovering the true problems| 170
Don't confuse goals with desires<br /><br />A proper goal is something that you really need to achieve. Desires are things that you want *that can prevent you from reaching your goals*.| 172
**Never rule out a goal because you think it's unattainable - be audacious** | 173
Tolerating a problem has the same consequences as failing to identify it | 175
Think about your problem as a set of outcomes produced by a machine<br />There are many paths to achieving your goals - you only need to find one that works<br /> Think of your plan as being like a movie script in that you visualize who will do what through time<br />Write down your plan for everyone to see and to measure your progress against| 177
Great planners who don't execute go nowhere<br />Establish clear metrics to make ertain that you are following your plan.| 178
Weaknesses don't matter if you find solutions <br /><br />Everyone has at least one big thing that stands in the way of their success; find yours and deal with it<br />Write down what your one big thing is (such as identifying problems, designing solutions, pushing throughto results) and why it exists (your emotions trip you up, you can't visualized adequate possibilities). While you may have more than one, if you can remove or get around that one really big one, you will hugely improve your life<br /><br />**_Note:_** This is basically Eli Goldratt's [Theory of Constaints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)) | 178
